  "q": "Tell me about yourself.",
  "a": "Sure. I'm Janaka, a senior full-stack Java/Spring engineer who loves turning complex systems into reliable, easy-to-run platforms. I've been building enterprise software since 2004, mostly in banking and the public sector, and I focus on measurable outcomes: faster platforms, cleaner releases, fewer incidents. I'm based in Zug on a Swiss C permit with a Belgian passport, so no sponsorship needed. I'm comfortable hybrid around Zurich/Zug, and my notice period is two months. Strengths: Java/Spring Boot, CI/CD and Kubernetes/OpenShift, Oracle performance tuning, and practical AI (RAG and lightweight agents) that plug into real workflows. Colleagues know me as steady under pressure and clear on priorities. Personally, I'm family-focused and practice mindfulness and meditation, which keeps me grounded. I'd love to learn more about your goals and where I can create impact."
